\section{INTRODUCTION}

Dawn War is a game of the interstellar war between two high-tech civilizations. One player controls the Morakian Confederation and its allies, the other plays the Neguulu Worlds and its allies.

This is a carddriven block wargame, where cards are played for either events or operations. Both players use operations to move fleets and engage the enemy in combat. Combat is fought both in space and on planetary surfaces using blocks to represent units.

Victory is won by capturing planets, or preventing their capture, during the course of the scenario.
