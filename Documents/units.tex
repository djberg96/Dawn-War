\section{UNITS}
The black and grey wooden blocks represent Morakian space and ground forces, respectively. The red and orange wooden blocks represent Neguulu space and ground forces, respectively. The larger blocks are always ships, bases or outposts, while the smaller blocks are always ground units.

Most units in play normally stand upright facing the owning player, either on the map or in the player’s fleet box. This provides a simple yet elegant Fog of War in that players cannot normally see the type or strength of opposing units until combat.

There are many different types of ships and ground units: Fighter, Scout, Destroyer, Cruiser, Battleship, Carrier, Outpost, Starbase, Admiral, Infantry, and Planetary Defense Units. Different types of units have different combat capabilities. See the “Block Data” section for more information about the values on each block.

Each side has 25 large blocks (ships, bases) and 25 small blocks (ground units).
