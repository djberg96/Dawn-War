\section{CARDS}
Each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards each turn. These are the cards that drive the game, and are played by each player, one at a time, until both players have played 5 cards, or run out of cards to play. The 6th card could be used for battle, or it may end up as an extra card that you can hold onto.

Each card has a value of 1, 2 or 3 on it that represents operations points (OP). Each card also has an event on it. When playing a card, the player has choice of using the card for OPâ€™s or the event. Certain events may only be played at the start of combat.

There are a total of 54 cards in the deck. The average OP value is just under 2
