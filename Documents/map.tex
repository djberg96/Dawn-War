\section{MAP}
The map consists of a series of connected circular points called “systems”. Each system represents a single solar system consisting of one or more planets, which are represented by a single square. The connection between the systems represent “jump points” that fleets use to quickly move from one solar system to another. Each system is considered “adjacent” to every system that it is connected to.

Each system is worth a certain number of Construction Points (CP) and Victory Points (VP). CP’s are used, in conjunction with bases, to repair ships. VP’s are used to determine the victor at the end of the scenario.

The Victory Point track is used to track each player’s victory points over the course of the game. It also doubles as a general records track for keeping track of CP’s and Repair Points (RP).
