\section{Game Turns}
Each turn in the game represents approximately 1 week of Earth time. A turn has multiple phases played in a particular sequence. The main portion of the turn is the Operations phase, where you play a card for an action. Each player will conduct up to five actions during the Operations Phase per turn.

If you are out of cards (because you, for example, used one or more cards for battle) then you must pass, potentially allowing your opponent multiple consecutive actions. You may not pass if you have any cards remaining.

Each scenario indicates which player starts first. Players alternate back and forth, performing an action in the Operations phase, until both players have performed five actions. The current player is the active player. The other player is the non-active player.

After both players have completed all of their operations, both players then regroup, repair and build.
